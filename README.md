# Lane Change Decision Making Using Deep Reinforcement Learning

This is the repo for a project on “Lane change decision-making through deep reinforcement learning with rule-based constraints,” by Junjie Wang, Qichao Zhang, Dongbin Zhao and Yaran Chen,  The International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), Budapest, Hungary, July 14 -19, 2019 . The goal was to replicate the results obtained by the authors of the paper. Experience replay and target model update were not implemented in the original repo. We have updated those in this repo.
